# Enron Social Triangle 

The goal of this notebook is to implement a Social Triangle algorithm using Apache Spark. For example, given the email dataset, we will list all "reciprocal" relationships in the company (If A emails B and B emails A, then A and B is *reciprocal*.)

**Dataset:** We will use a subset of the open [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/ "Enron Email Dataset"), which contains approximately 10,000 simplified email headers from the Enron Corporation.
